Eye Tracking Study Data

Data is divided into two folders:
1.) ET Fixation Data
  - Separated into folders for Experts, Novice BC and Novice MC
  - The folder contain the semantic gaze mapping (AOI related) data from the ET studies per trial and the converted string form.
2.) Pattern Frequency
  - .mat files of the calculated k-mer pattern frequencies that were used for the analysis.
  - .mat files are structs that contain for each participant the k-mer pattern sequence and the frequency of appearance.
  
Finally, "Participant Characteristics.xlsx" file contains the participant numbering and age information.
